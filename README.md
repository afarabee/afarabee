## Hi there, I’m Aimee 👋

Director-level Product & AI Enablement leader who turns ambiguous AI chaos into systems that actually work.  
I build human-centered AI products in complex, regulated environments and I sleep just fine knowing they hold up in the real world.

I like my AI useful, my roadmaps grounded in reality, and my products shipped, adopted, and defensible.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Lead AI product strategy, enablement, and governance at scale 
- Build and launch generative AI products in life sciences, healthcare, and for personal use  
- Design AI intake, prioritization, and risk management frameworks that people actually follow  
- Translate executive ambition into shipped, adopted, measurable outcomes
- Personally design, build, and test AI workflows, prompts, and evaluation frameworks beyond my day job  
- Continuously upskill through hands-on experimentation with new models, tools, and AI patterns

---

## 🧩 Areas I Obsess Over

- Building products and platforms that drive tangible enterprise transformation and business results
- AI governance, risk, and controls that do not kill innovation  
- Rapid prototyping, structured learning cycles, and incremental releases that prioritize value 
- Adoption, behavior change, and real productivity gains  
- Turning “we should use AI” into "why did we take so long to start using AI?"

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Work With

- Generative AI platforms and LLMs  
- Azure, GitHub, DevOps tooling
- Any low/no-code tool I can get my hands on
- AI Risk frameworks
- Enough spreadsheets to frighten lesser mortals

## 🧠 Philosophy

- AI should earn trust, not demand it  
- Small wins compound faster than moonshots  
- Governance is a product, not a policy  
- If no one adopts it, it does not matter how clever it is  

Also, if your AI strategy requires vibes and hope, we need to talk.
